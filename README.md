# Bitcoin Halving Cycles: A Detailed Examination of Peak Daily Prices

## Intro

Hello and welcome, Bitcoin enthusiasts! As we stand less than a year away from the next anticipated 'Bitcoin halving', it's the perfect time to delve into this crucial phenomenon. Occurring approximately every four years, these halving events cut the reward for mining Bitcoin in half and kickstart a new 'halving cycle.' But what happens to Bitcoin's peak daily prices during these cycles?

In this in-depth exploration, we turn the spotlight on the complexities of these halving cycles, specifically examining the highest daily price within each one. To give you an authentic depiction of the price dynamics during these periods, we've pulled price data from 2013-04-28, effectively mapping out most of Bitcoin's price rollercoaster.

For the sake of clarity and comparative analysis, we've normalized all price points within each cycle. Then, we set out on a journey to dissect the behaviour of these prices, aiming to demystify Bitcoin's price trends during each halving cycle.

And for those who like to dig even deeper, all of the code used in our analysis is available in this same repository.

So, as we edge closer to the next halving, join us in this revealing journey. Let's shed some light on the fascinating interplay between Bitcoin's halving cycles and their influence on the cryptocurrency's highest daily prices!
